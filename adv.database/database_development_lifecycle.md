# Database System Development Lifecycle

## 1. Database Planning

Requirement gathering, understanding the data requirement of the organizations and stakeholder.

Clearly define the objectives, constraints, and boundaries of the database system.

## 2. Database analysis

Analyze the current data sources, format and relationship.
Define the rules governing data integrity, security and usage.

## 3. Database design

*Conceptual design* - create a high-level data model(E/R diagrams)capturing entities, attritubes, and relationship.

*logical design* - convert conceptual model to a normalized relational schema.

*Physical design* - specify the physical storage structures, indexing and partitioning strategies

## 4. Implementation

*Schema implementation* - create the database schema using database language.

*Data population* - load initial data into the database from existing sources.

*Application Development* - develop/modify applications that interact with the database.

## 5. Testing and deployment

*Unit testing* - test individual components i.e database tables, views, and stored procedures.

*Integration testing* - validate interaction between different database components and application.

*User Acceptance Testing* - involve end-users to validate the system against requirements

*Deployment* - install the database system in the production environment.

## 6. Operation and maintenance

manage the transition of data from old systems to the new database

monitor and optimize database performance

implement strategies to protect data and ensure business continuity.

making modifications to improve the database.

## 7. Evaluation and Optimization

Gather feedbacks from users to identify areas for improvement.

optimize queries, indexes and database configuration based on usage patterns.
